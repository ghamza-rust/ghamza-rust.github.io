# Object Oriented

What is Object Oriented (OO)?

One answer to this question is "The combination of data and function." Although often cited, this is a very unsatisfying answer because it implies that `o.f()` is somehow different from `f(o)`. This is absurd.

Another standard answer to this question is "A way to model the real world." This statement is intended to imply that OO makes software easier to understand because it has a closer relationship to the real world - but even that statement is evasive and too loosely defined. It does not tell us what OO is.

Some folks fall back on three magic words to explain the nature of OO: _encapsulation_, _inheritance_, and _polymorphism_. The implication is that OO is the proper admixture of these three things or at least an OO language must support these three things.
