# Introduction

This book is going to cover the Rust programming language. First, let us get motivated.

Some people decided to learn rust because it has been the most loved language for seven years.

Others are interested in what problems it solves.

Some geeks might only be interested in how rust works. They heard about the rust's ownership. In a typical software, you either manually manage the memory or throw this responsibility to a garbage collector, a software that runs alongside yours. Rust ensures memory safety without other software running on the side.

Or you might be looking at the new generation programming language and find a "Go vs. Rust."

For most people, it is all of the above, having a language that is loved by a lot of people, being compared to both system language (such as C/C++) and application language (such as Go), and the curiosity about how the rust's ownership and borrow checker work is what attract engineers to learn rust.

This also covers general software engineering concepts to better understand Rust.

The purpose of rust is to be a system language, so most of the talk will be regarding how the system works.

System programming is for:

- Operating systems
- Device drivers
- Filesystems
- Databases
- Resource constraint devices
- Cryptography
- Networking
- Creating high-level programming language (e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript)
- Media processing
- Media codec
- Virtualization and software containers
- Scientific simulation
- Game development
- Encryption
